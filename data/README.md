# Yelp Dataset Access

This project uses the [Yelp Open Dataset](https://business.yelp.com/data/resources/open-dataset/), which contains 6.9 million reviews and metadata across 150,000 businesses.

Due to licensing and file size, the raw JSON files are not included in this repository.

To run this project:
1. Download the dataset from the link above.
2. Extract and place the following files in a `data/` directory:
   - yelp_academic_dataset_business.json
   - yelp_academic_dataset_review.json
