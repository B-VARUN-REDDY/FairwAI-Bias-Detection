ðŸš¨ Important Notice on Dataset Access

To reduce repository size and avoid GitHub limits, all large data files (JSON, CSV, and Yelp TAR/ZIP files) have been excluded.

If you wish to replicate the project:

Download the Yelp Open Dataset:
https://www.yelp.com/dataset

Download and extract the following files:

yelp_academic_dataset_business.json

yelp_academic_dataset_review.json

yelp_academic_dataset_user.json

Place them in a local data/ directory or wherever referenced in the scripts.

Run the scripts in order:

Step 1 â†’ Filter businesses in target cities

Step 2 â†’ Extract relevant reviews

Step 3 â†’ Flag potential bias using keyword matching

Step 4 â†’ Generate visuals from the flagged data

ðŸ“ˆ Sample Visuals Included

Top cities by flagged bias keywords

These were generated from the filtered data and are safe to view without the full dataset.
